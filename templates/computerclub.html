              The computer science club is designed to use computer science, programming in such a way so as to motivate the high school students to learn and innovate better. Research shows that today’s students are motivated to learn using technology and connecting the learning to real-life applications. Our club would capitalize on this concept. Our college has been successful in building up the career of thousands of students in Engineering and medical field. Hundreds of students are studying in the top ranked engineering and medicals institutes. There are clubs for students interested in robotics, speech, literature and research activities. However, enough push has been found lacking in the field of computer science and technology. There are many more students in our college interested in the field and IT. And willing to do something different and innovate something new. However, lack of enough opportunities, resources has kept them lagging behind. In a survey conducted among different sections of our college it was found that almost 50% of the students are willing to pursue their future career in Computer Science. Many students no without a doubt have the innovative ideas that could make up a blow in the field of computer and technology, but they don’t have a platform to showcase it. Computer science club would support students as act as a platform to encourage students to bring up something new in field of it meanwhile supporting the ones interested to learn something new and act as a platform to share knowledge. Likewise, college team could participate in the national and international level Hackathons which sure would be a new and progressive achievement for the college. Our college has excelled in every fields and competitions even the International Physics Olympiad so why leave the tech field behind. We’re sure our students can definitely bag up medals in the National and International Hackathons too. Likewise, with the proper facilitation for the students to build up their Maker’s Portfolio project which are even preferred by the top universities of the world, enrolment of students in top universities such as MIT, Harvard, Stanford shall surely increase and the success story of KMCians would be praised internationally.
